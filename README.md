# TrackSystem
TrackSystem is a basic concept based on the daily tools of the servers with better handling in a matter of moderation, the idea arises from being able to take and capture clear evidence about people who break the rules. TrackSystem allows you to specify a player and the same system will not allow you to separate yourself from the player within a radius of 20 blocks. Note that if the player changes the world, the system sends you to the world of the player you are specifying.
